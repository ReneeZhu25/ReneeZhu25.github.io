    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:#FFFFFF;">Chinese Oracle Bone Script</h1>
    <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The Chinese Oracle Bone Script was the earliest form of the Chinese script. It was first used over 3000 years ago during the late <a href="Shang.html">Shang Dynasty</a>.</p>
    <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The scripts were rectilinear and <a href="Shang.html">PICTOGRAPHIC FORMS</a> that were carved on <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/60696">OX SHOULDER BONES</a> and <a href="https://asia-archive.si.edu/learn/for-educators/teaching-china-with-the-smithsonian/explore-by-object/inscribed-tortoise-shell-oracle-bone/">TORTOISE SHELLS</a>, also known as plastron.</p>
    <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The royal household used bone oracles to communicate with ancestors and deities and was believed to have the power to bestow fortune, disasters, and guidance on the living world.</p>
    <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The first Chinese oracle bone script found was in <a href="Xiaotun.html">XIAOTUN</a> by local farmers in the late 1800's.</p>
    <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Official excavations began at the site in 1928 and the bones were authenticated by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Li-Chi">LI JI</a> (also known as LI CHI).</p>
    <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Chinese Oracle Bones scripts have evolved into the <a href="scripts.html">MODERN CHINESE SCRIPT</a> seen today.</p>
